# ampy

ampy is a Python library that interfaces between the various front- and
back-end components of the
[AMP active measurement system](http://amp.wand.net.nz). It serves as the
intermediary between the web interface (amp-web) and databases used to store
the data for display - the AMP site meta data database, the views database for
storing website related configuration, the events database and the measurement
database itself (nntsc).
